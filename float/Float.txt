FLoat point Stack
st0 to st7 = 80 bit registers
These registers are used as a stack

fld = loads value in st0 when consecutive fld occurs the st0 value is moved to st1 and new value
is loaded in st0
fadd st0,st1 = adds float values st0 = st0+st1
fsub st0,st1 = float subtact st0 = st0 - st1
fsubr st0,st1 = float reverse subtraction st0 = st1-st0
fst qword[variable] = store value from st0 to variable
fstp qword[vaiable] = store value from st0 to variable and pop from the stack

--
For printing a float value do the following
  sub esp,8
  fstp qword[esp]
  
  push msg
  call printf
  add esp,12
