asm ("assembly code");
IF you have more than one instruction then the newline character must be used 
to separate the instruction and tab character to align 

mov eax,1
mov ebx,0
int 0x80   exit(0);

asm ("movl $1,%eax\n\t"
     "movl $0, %ebx\n\t"
     "int $0x80"); 

Whenever you want to use varialbles in Inline assembly, you can not use local varialbles. They should be global variables
